#Mini Pro 2: The AI Face Scanner
Mini Pro 2 is a lightweight, browser-based AI tool that guesses a person's age and gender in real-time. By combining the power of your device's camera with advanced Machine Learning, it turns a simple webpage into a futuristic biometric scanner.

#Why I Built This
I wanted to explore how AI can interact with humans through a simple web interface. Using Python concepts translated into JavaScript, I built this to show that high-tech face detection doesn't need a massive server—it can happen right in your browser, instantly.

#Features
Live Biometrics: Uses a "Tiny Face Detector" to track your face with minimal lag.
Age Estimation: Analyzes facial features to guess your current age.
Smart Averaging: Includes a logic system that averages data over time to give you a more stable and accurate result.
Privacy First: All processing happens locally on your device. No images are ever sent to a server.

#The Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (for that neon scanner vibe).
Logic: JavaScript (ES6+).
The Brain: face-api.js (built on TensorFlow.js).

#How to Use It
Open the live link.
Grant camera permissions (don't worry, I can't see you!).
Wait for the "AI Online" status.
Watch the scanner track your face in real-time.
Click "Show Final Results" to see your session summary.
